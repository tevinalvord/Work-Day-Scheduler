# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Purpose
A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day. The page displays the current day and month. You can save an event for each common working hour of the day. If the hour of the day is in the future the background color will be green, if the hour of the day is the current hour the background color will be red, if the hour of the day has passed the background color will be grey. Click the blue save box to save your event.
